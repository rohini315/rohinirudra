                        Sweatshop- where the latte art is just as visually stimulating as the café
                        I was immediately hooked after savoring my first sip of an authentic Aussie flat white (micro-foam over a single or double shot of espresso). The latte art is just as visually stimulating as the café. Sweatshop truly encapsulates the creative spirit of Williamsburg. The owners, Luke and Ryan are talented graphic designers from Melbourne. They completely gut renovated a former old sandwich bodega on Metropolitan Avenue and transformed it into a dual work studio and Melbourne-style coffee shop. The bare bones and minimal design aesthetic is perfect to help stimulate one’s creative process. I love working on my laptop along side with other artistic people enjoying a coldie (cold brew) and watching the passer byers heading towards Bedford Ave.

                        I just recently stumbled upon Café Devocion this summer, and I have no idea how I missed it, its massive! The café and roasting plant is over 3,000 square feet with high vaulted ceilings, a glass sky roof and a wall covered with thousands of sprouting coffee plants. The café is adorned with plush leather sofas and hand carved wooden table and chairs. What is different about Devocion is how they acquired their coffee. Most of the coffee beans are from remote and untouched areas of South America. The soil is more fertile; producing a purer flavored bean, with is evident when you taste the coffee.  It’s a great café to spend your lazy Sunday morning lounging on a couch and reading The New York Times with your coffee in hand.

                        Blue Bottle has perfected the art of coffee and turned it into a science. Originally from Oakland, California, it has expanded rapidly opening up storefronts in San Francisco, New York and even Japan. The Williamsburg location is my favorite (obviously). The airy floor plan and the large bay windows make it an ideal to enjoy their famous New Orleans Cold Brew.  However, sipping their famed coffee comes with a price; the Blue Bottle buzz has generated huge lines that extend to the sidewalk. The wait is definitely worth it.  The barista’s have created an efficient system that keeps the line moving, while still concocting a delectable cup of coffee.
