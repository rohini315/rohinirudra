					<h3>Background and brief </h3>
					<p>I was hired as a UX/UI designer to help with the next phase of the design process for AudioDrops' mobile app. At first it was a daunting task being the only designer and starting off where the last designer left off, but I was willing to take that challenge. My brief was to re-design the mobile interface as well as add some new features to make the app more user friendly. The company's main goal was to try and get users to walk around and discover new music along the way.</p>
				</div> 

				<div class="text-width">
					<h3>Understood the new business objectives and uncovered users pain points.</h3>
					<p> To gain more insight, I interviewed the Founders and CEO on the app/companies history. The UI had gone through several major changes in the past few years. They were in the process of speaking with different music tourism boards in various cities, and wanted to create a universal way to engage individuals users, as well as larger organizations.</p>
				</div> 
				
				<div class="text-width">
					<h3>Uncovered major UX/UI problems</h3>
						<p>Before I conducted any user testing, I noticed a lot of problems being a new user myself. I wanted to see if the problems I had with the app would match up to what other new users felt.  </p>
				</div>
		
				<div class="text-width">
					<h3>Conducted multiple user tests to pinpoint painpoints</h3>
						<p>I conducted over ten user tests where I had each user download the app, create an account and have them drop their first song. I then asked each user to complete a series of tasks and asked them to think out loud.<br>
						<p> Some of the pain points users had were:
							<ul>
								<li> Users had a difficult time figuring out how to navigate to another user’s profile page and follow them.</li>
								<li> Users didn’t understand what the ‘collection’ tab was for.</li>
								<li>Unsure if drop was successful after clicking the drop button.</li>
								<li>Did not understand the difference between Your Set’s Drops vs ____’s drops in the sidebar menu.</li>
								<li> Once connected to Spotify- users were unsure if it was properly connected - Before clicking the sidebar menu, thought the tabs would be related to account settings</li>
								<li> Thought they had to log into Spotify before searching for a song- unclear directions</li>
								<li>Wanted to choose what songs would be added to their collection</li>
								<li>Some thought the main ‘drops’ tab would recenter the map</li>
								<li>Some users had a difficult time finding the logout button</li>
							</ul>
						</p>

						<p>After conducting each test I asked for overall feedback. Many of the users shared the same thoughts as me: Very interesting application, but UX needs to be more clear.</p>
					</div>
						<div class="text-width" ><h2><span class="head-style">Brainstorming</span></h2></div>	
					<div class="text-width">
						<p>I shared all the data I had collected with the founders and the developers. We all sat down and prioritized what user pain points we should tackle first.</p>
						<p>My next steps were to start with sketching out some pen and paper wireframes that addressed some of the apps major issues. My plan is to keep working on pen and paper sketches, doing some more user testing and then translating those into lo-fi mockups in sketch. </p>

						<p> I had a great time at AudioDrops and working with the team. I was offered a position at antoher company and couldn't continue my work here, but I was happy to help out! </p>
