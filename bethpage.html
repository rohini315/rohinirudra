					<h3>What's the Problem?</h3>
						<p>
							Bethpage State Golf Course is one of the most well known public golf courses in the US. Multiple PGA tournaments have been held here, attracting people from all over the world. Bethpage is an institutional golf course and has so much history, but its technology is still stuck in the past. Players have to call and go through a series of prompts to actually book a tee time. Or get this: they have to fax a form with all of their information! (Who even owns a fax machine?!) On weekends there are long lines, and golfers do not have the ability to book a tee time in advance. The Golf Industry is highly competitive, and companies and golf courses are constantly trying new ways to stay ahead of the curve to keep attracting golfers.

					<h3>Goals and Objectives</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>User interviews and observation to find pain points.</li>
						<li>Prototyping and evolving ideas as wireframes.</li>
						<li>Creating high-fidelity visual mockups with improved visual design.</li>
						<li>Testing with users and suggesting future improvements.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Current Way to Book a Tee Time</h3>
						<p>If you’ve ever called for a tee time, I’m sure you’re familiar with the dance you go through. First, you call the Golf Shop, and if you avoid voicemail or a busy signal, perhaps you’ll get the young assistant pro or telephone operator. Your conversation likely goes something like this:</p>

				<div class="text-width">
					<h3>Interviewed target users to gauge major pain points</h3>
						<p>I created a google survey that was shared via email, slack channels, and facebook. I started the survey with a a screener question, asking people whether they have ever played a round of golf. This question helped me exclude users who did not match the target audience. The primary users of this application would be golfers who lived on Long Island, NY. I conducted 12 in-person interviews and recorded all their responses.</p>
					<h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
						<p>I grouped the data from the interviews into different categories. That helped us get a better understanding our users habits and pain points.</p>

				<div class="text-width">
					<h3>Developed two main personas based on user research</h3>
						<p>From the affinity map, we inferred that we had two main categories of customers. We created personas to represent them.</p>

				<div class="text-width">
					<h3>Research Outcomes</h3>
						<p>After interviewing and speaking with my target user group, it was apparent that there was a huge problem with the existing tee time reservations system. Many of the users are already familiar with the app GolfNow, which allows users to book tee times at thousands of different golf courses. However, asking speaking with some stakeholders, they felt it was more important to maintain Bethpage's brand identity. They wanted to create a more convenient way to book a tee time and help maintain the pace of play for each course.</p>

				<div class="text-width" ><h2><span class="head-style">Planning</span></h2></div>

				<div class="text-width">
					<h3>Considerations and Assumptions</h3>
					<div class="summary-block">
						<div class="summary-block-content"> 
							<ul>
								<li>Each individual golf course's tee time prices vary.</li>
								<li>There are different prices for residents, non-residents, seniors and juniors.</li>
								<li>Discounted tee times are offered during twilight hours.</li>
								<li>Make it accessible for all different types of users (tech/non-tech savvy, senior users).</li>
							</ul>

					<h3>User Flows</h3>
						<p>After collecting all of my data from interviews and looking at other golf tee time apps, I started mapping out the layout of each screen. Creating a user flow diagram helped me determine the number of screens that I needed and the different pathways a user could encounter. My goal was to create a simple and easy to navigate app that would allow users to book a tee time quick and efficiently.</p>

				<div class="text-width">
					<h3>Created pen & paper wireframes lo-fidelety mockup on sketch</h3>
					<p>Looking back at the user surveys, I had to keep in mind that some of my target users would be older and not as tech savvy. My solutions was to breakdown each step of the booking process into individual screens, so the user can focus on one task at a time. I also wanted it to be easy to navigate back to previous screens and have the menu accessible at all times. </p>

					<h3>Cohesive Style Guide</h3>
						<p>	I Wanted to create a more modern visual design while still maintaining the Bethpage Brand.</p>

				<div class="text-width" ><h2><span class="head-style">Prototyping</span></h2></div>
				
				<div class="text-width">
					<h3>Created an interactive prototype in inVision and Marvel</h3>
					<p>After making a few changes to the lo-fi wireframes and fine tuned the style guide, I designed all the screens using sketch and imported them using inVision to create a clickable prototype. </p>

				</div>
				
				<div class="text-width">
					<h3>Used prototype to conducted usability tests</h3>
					<p>Once the designs were completed I conducted various usability tests at Bethpage State Golf Course. Users were asked to complete a series of tasks and I had someone take notes during each session. The sessions captured golfers navigational choices, task completion, comments, overall satisfaction ratings, questions and feedback. The biggest validation was when users commented about the clean design, and liked how each screen was dedicated to one specific task- something that was lacking in other similar tee time apps.</p>

				<div class="text-width" ><h2><span class="head-style">Reflection & Next Steps</span></h2></div>
				<div class="text-width">
					<p> I really enjoyed working on this project from start to finish. The biggest takeaway from this project was learning how to have empathy for your users. At first it was difficult separating my personal design tastes from the users needs. Based on some of the feedback from conducting user tests and looking back on my design process these are some of the things I would go back and change/ add to a future design iteration: </p>

					<div class="summary-block-content"> 
						<ul>
							<li>Adding a feature where users can select 9/18 holes.</li>
							<li>Allowing users to select a time/date and have all of the tee time options for every course.</li>
							<li>Add a progress tracker- allows the users to see how many steps there and highlights which step they are on.</li>
							<li>Have a notification system if tee time is in 15 min/running late.</li>
							<li>Have an admin view for golf starters to help track pace of play.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
						<p> I really enjoyed going through the entire UX process for this project, and as a golfer I hope this app will help other golfers and encourage them to keep playing more! </p>
