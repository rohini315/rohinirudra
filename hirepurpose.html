						<h3>
							Stakeholder Interview
						</h3>
						<p>Right when I joined I met with the key stakeholders in the company to gain a better understanding of the company's business model and goals for the upcoming quarter. During the meeting we clarified project goals and success criteria with the stakeholders. One of the main takeaways from the meeting was that veterans are a very niched group of users and their needs and motivations <strong>are not the same </strong> as job seekers in the civilian world.</p>
					</div>
						<div class="text-width">
						<h3>
							Business Goals and Objectives
						</h3>
						<ul><li>Streamline the candidate onboarding process</li>
							<li>Increase the number of candidate sign ups</li>
							<li>Increases the number of job applies per candidate</li>
							<li>Increase the number of email subscribers</li>
							<li>Make applying for a job quick and easy</li>
							<li>Have more accurate job recommendations</li>
						</ul>
						</div>

					<div class="text-width" ><h2><span class="head-style">User Research</span></h2>

					<div class="text-width">
						<h3>
							Catching up
						</h3>
						<p> I knew that before I could get started with anything I needed to do some research about the veteran/military community. There were so many things I needed to learn more about such as what an <a href="https://www.military1.com/all/article/318929-what-are-mos-codes/" target="_blank">MOS</a> was, the difference between a military/government resume and so much more. I learned about how veterans can help diversify a team within a company however, many veterans and their set of skills of often overlooked during the hiring process.

						<h3>
							Understanding the User
						</h3>
						<p> After learning more about the veteran/military community I had the opportunity to interview a group of veterans, military spouses and active duty members. I had asked questions to discover their motivations, behaviors and pain points regarding the job search process: </p>
							<ul>
							<li><i>Are you currently looking for a job?</i></li>
							<li><i>Are you looking for a job that relates to your MOS?</i></li>
							<li><i>What's the most difficult part of the job search process?</i></li>
							<li><i>Where do you look/search for new job opportunities?</i></li>
		
					</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="text-width">
					<h3>Key Findings </h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Using online job board platforms is more trusted and easier to use than going to <a href="https://www.benefits.va.gov/tap/tap-index.asp" target="_blank"> TAP office </a> on base.</li>
							<li>Location and MOS were the two most important things when looking at a job post.</li>
							<li>Having accurate job recommendations and not hearing back from hiring manager were common frustrations.</li>

					<h3>User Personas </h3>
					<p> Developed a few user personas based on user interviews as well as looking at the demographics/data gathered throughout the years.</p>

					<div class="text-width">
				<h3>Affinity Mapping </h3>
				<p>Before kicking things off, we thought affinity mapping would be a great brainstorming tool to help organize all our thoughts, data and findings from the user interviews/research.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="post-image">
						<center><img src="affinitydiagram.png"></center>
				<span class="img-caption">We had people from the engineering team, marketing team, and client success team participate in this brainstorming session
</span></div>
				<div class="text-width">
				<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
				<p>Affinity mapping helped the team realize that a lot of the problems were stemming from candidate onboarding. <strong> We decided that tackling and streamlining the candidate onboarding experience</strong> would align with the company's business goals.</p>

				<div class="text-width">
						<h3>
							Design Game Plan
						</h3>
						<p>Candidate onboarding is something that was overlooked by the company. It's important because User experience starts from here. <br><br> We needed to collect a lot of information from candidates such as contact, resume, MOS, military branch, target occupations, skills etc. If we can embed information collection into the onboarding process naturally, users will get more accurate matches right away and feel more compelled to apply for a job.</p>
				</div>
					<div class="text-width">
						<h3>
							Ideal Candidate Flow
						</h3>
						<p>Our goal was to streamline the onboarding process as well as making sure the candidate filled out all the required fields without it being too overwhelming.</p>

					<div class="text-width">
						<h3>
							Quick Pen and Paper Wireframes
						</h3>
						<p>I knew I didn't want to overwhelm the user by having them fill out a ton of fields right from the get go. I felt that breaking things down into a few steps would enable to the users to fill out all the needed fields without having too much thrown at them at once.</p>

				</div>
					<div class="text-width">
						<h3>
							Being Built Out
						</h3>
						<p>The Dev team is currently working hard and making lots of new changes and adding features to both the client and candidate facing interfaces. I'm looking forward to doing some more in-depth user testing once things are finalized!</p>
					</div>
				<div class="text-width" ><h2><span class="head-style">My Reflections</span></h2>
					<h3>
						Self Learning and Learning how to become a better designer
						</h3>
						<p> Being the only designer within the company was definitely challenging at times. If there was something I was unsure about I would take my own initiative and learn and test things out. I was very fortunate that my team was very open to trying out different tools and processes- it definitely helped us with figuring out the workflow. I know ideally I would have wanted my design process to be more iterative, however being a smaller sized start up we had to get things built quickly. Learning to think on my feet as well as having limited resources has made me a stronger designer. <br>  I’m really looking forward to seeing how the candidate features turn out and finally getting to test out the new designs and flow! Stay tuned to see the testing results and data!</p>

						<h3>
						My Biggest Take Aways
						</h3>
								<ul>
							<li>Figuring out the Zeplin and Red Pen were the best tools that worked for both the dev team and me.</li>
							<li>Learning how to take feedback from skateholders and tweaking the way my designs are presented in order for everyone to be on the same page.</li>
							<li>Making sure to make graudal design changes opposed to a total re-design was better for our user group.</li>
							<li> Looking at data and doing research to make design decisions outways asethetics.</li>
