        <p>I'd love to be part of Glossier's Technology team as a <span id="bold">Frontend Developer Intern</span>. I have always been fascinated in the intersection between design and technology. This past summer I reified my interests by enrolling into an intensive web development bootcamp at the New York Code + Design Academy. There, my passions aligned with frontend design. Having just graduated from NYU, with a degree in  Art History, I am able to intertwine my knowledge and love of art and design by creating interactive web applications.  I've taken a lot of inspiration from the Glossier brand and implemented them into my own designs. I would love the opportunity of being part of such a dynamic team, where I would not only contribute, but also learn and grow as a developer. </p>

        <p> Learning how to code has taught me to think unconventionally to solve any problem and to think on my feet. My internship at Quintessentailly Lifestyles made me very comfortable working under deadlines with the need for perfection. I assisted the team in the creative and technical elements of its marketing initiatives, which included data mining and researching, print and web development, writing and editing content for twenty-five of the company’s “City Guides.” The skills that I gained for the New York Code + Design Academy and Quintessentially would be easily transferrable to the Glossier Team. Coming from a liberal arts background into a more technical one, I am able to communicate with both sides to help fix any problems.</p>

        <p>For the longest time, I was the girl who knew nothing about makeup. After following Into the Gloss and visiting the Glossier showroom and for the launch the Phase 2 set, I've become more confident with my makeup skills and able to acheive #browgoals with the help of boy brow. With my diverse experiences, desire to keep learning and growing, and familiarity with the brand I would make a valuable addition to Glossier Team. </p>
