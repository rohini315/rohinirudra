    <span id="descript">Description of the film:</span><br>

    Am I the Dream Or The Dreamer tells the transformative story of the internationally known band The Low Anthem - in the words of lead Ben Knox Miller. Featuring unseen archival footage and unheard tracks, this whimsical film shines a light on the creative process of independent musicians and artists, in a way that very few can. <br><br>

    Ben Knox Miller and Jeff Prystowsky, founders of The Low Anthem, decide to call a hiatus at the peak of their career, following their gut instinct to inhabit the Columbus Theatre, an abandoned opera house in Providence, Rhode Island. In the process of recording their fourth and latest album, Eyeland, they find themselves building a recording studio and producing over 30 albums for other musicians, including jazz drummer Brian Blade.<br><br>

    Simultaneously, Ben and Jeff decide to revive the theatre, making it a destination spot for national acts, such as Sam Beam (Iron&Wine). The film follows the history of the Columbus, dating from 1926 until present time, highlighting the impact the theatre has had on the Providence music and arts scene. After The Low Anthem's four year break from touring, and having completed a musical metamorphosis, the band sets out to tour the Northeast USA, only to encounter a life changing obstacle that almost costs them their lives.
