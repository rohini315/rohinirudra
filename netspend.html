					<div class="text-width">
						<p>
							The Online Account (OAC) allows users access and and see all their prepaid account details on the go. They can sign up for Direct Deposits, see their recent transactions, transfer money and save. It gives them many of the features a traditional bank offers. The OAC hasn't been updated in a few years, and has gotten a bit outdated and difficult to navigate. 
						
					</div>
					<div class="text-width" ><h2><span class="head-style">The Problem</span></h2>
					</div>
					<div class="text-width">
						<p>
							The current navigation and dashboard design make it difficult for users to access items/functions they use daily. All the navigation items are under a big nested hamburger menu that makes it harder to figure out where to go and buries a lot of useful features. The dashboard design is cluttered and doesn't allow users to see their recent activity at a glance. This has caused a lot of users to call customer service and ask for assistance when they are unable to find something.   </p>

					<div class="text-width" ><h2><span class="head-style">The Goals</span></h2>
					</div>
					<div class="text-width">
						<h3>
							Our Users + Their Needs
						</h3>
						<p> Our users are a very niche group of people. Many are underbanked and do not have the resources to get a traditional bank account. Through a lot of user interviews and in-person testing it was eye-opening learning more about their motivations and needs when it comes to their finances.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Streamlined on-boarding and activation process</li>
							<li> Clear labels for navigation items and know where most used features are located </li>
							<li>Be able to easily access OAC via there mobile device</li>
							<li>Be able to check their balance and recent transactions at a glance</li>
							<li>Have the option to easily transfer money in and out of their prepaid account</li>
							<li>Savings feature, rewards and budgeting tools</li>
						</ul>

						Current Status 
						<p>
							We are still in the process of doing more in-person testing and iterating on our designs. The new re-design is planned to launch later this year!  </p>
